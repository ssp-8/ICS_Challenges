# ICS_Challenges
This repo is for weekly challenges of ICS

You will be given two questions every week to solve:
1. The Cursed Code
2. The Goblet of Code

So, here it is:
The Cursed Code is a error filled C code that you have to debug. You have to understand what the code is doing and debug it fully. After debugging, run the sample test case(s) and do things as per the instruction to get the secret word that will be the answer

Goblet of Code is a coding question that will be given to solve. Again run the sample test cases to get the secret word that will be your answer

You have to upload your code files and a .txt file containing the secret words of both the questions. Questions of every week will be posted every Saturday night and you can submit till Saturday evening 5:30. So, I can explain the question in the doubt session later in Saturday evening.
