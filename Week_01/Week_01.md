# ICS Group 03 Challenge Week 01
March 01 2025 - March 08 2025

## Topic of the week: Loops and Arrays

### Cursed Code

You are given a code that does a basic stack implementation. Stacks are useful structures that follow LIFO (Last In, First Out) policy - like the pile of plates in your mess. The last plate to be placed on the top will be used first. The functions that we use are:
1. **Push** - puts the element on top of the stack. If we push more than the limit, it `must throw an error`.
2. **Pop** - removes the top most element. If we try to remove even after stack is empty, it `must throw an error`.
3. **Peek** - returns the top element only when stack is non empty.

However, there is/are error(s) in the code. So, fix the error and run the code to a list of numbers. Type in the search engine the numbers, concatenated by `.`. This will land you somewhere very interesting. Type the name of the interesting thing as the answer to this question.

### Goblet of Code
You have to write a C program to print the following pattern for a given case n = 3:

1 1 1 1 1 <br>
1 2 2 2 1 <br>
1 2 3 2 1 <br>
1 2 2 2 1 <br>
1 1 1 1 1 <br>

Once you are done coding for this, test it for `n = 6` and sum the entire matrix to be sum. The secret word would be **sum<sup>th</sup>** word in this document. 

`Note`: __Count all special characters, numbers as a single word__
